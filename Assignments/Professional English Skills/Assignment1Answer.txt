	"Please submit your reports by Friday for the upcoming meeting", is more effective.
	3. Consideration: When giving feedback, consider the other person's feelings. 
	Instead of saying "You're not meeting expectations" say, 
	"I appreciate your efforts; let's discuss areas of improvement".
	4. Concreteness: Instead of saying, "Improve your performance" be concrete: "Increase your sales by 10% in the next quarter."
	5. Correctness: Ensure accuracy in written communication. An email with correct spelling, grammar and facts enhances crediblity.
	6. Courtesy: Even in disagreement, maintain courtsey. Instead if saying "Your idea won't work" 
	say, "I see your prespective; let's explore other options together."

	specify: "Please submit your quarterly sales report by 3PM on Friday."
