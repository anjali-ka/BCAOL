Q1. If the probability of event A is 0.3, what is the probability of the complement of A?
Ans. The probability of the complement of event A((A^c)) is foud by subtracting 
the probability of A from 1. Therefore, if the probability of event A is 0.3,
the probability of the complement of A is:

P(A^c) = 1 - P(A) 
P(A^c) = 1 - 0.3 
P(A^c) = 0.7

So the probability of complement of A is 0.7

Q2. Given matrices F and G:
	F = |2 3|,  G = |1 0|
		|1 4|		|5 2|
	Find F+G and F-G.
Ans. Findig F + G:
	|2 3| + |1 0| = |2+1 3+0| = |3 3|
	|1 4|	|5 2|	|1+5 4+2|	|6 6|
	
	Finding F - G:
	|2 3| + |1 0| = |2-1 3-0| = |1  3|
	|1 4|	|5 2| = |1-5 4-2|	|-4 2|
	

Q3. Consider two events A and B. If the probability of A is 0.4 and the probability of B is 0.6, what is the Law of Total Probability?
Ans. 

Q4. Consider the matrix:
		|2 4 6|
	B =	|1 3 5|
		|7 8 9|
	Calculate the minor and cofactor of the element in the first 
	row and second column.
Ans. 
	First row and second column of above matrix is B12 = 4
	
	Minor of element is:
	 B12 =	|1 5| = 1x9 - 5x7 = 9 - 35 = -26
			|7 9|
			
	Cofactor of element is:
	B12 = (-1)^1+2 x (-26) = (-1) x (-26) = 26
	

Q5. Let H = |2 1|
			|3 4|
	Find 2H
Ans.   H =	|2 1|
			|3 4|
			
	  2H = 2|2 1|
			|3 4|
	
	  2H = 	|2x2 2x1|
			|2x3 2x4|
	
	  2H = 	|4 2|
			|6 8|
			
Q6. Given the matrix 
	M = |2 1|
		|3 4|
	Find the determinant using the elimination method.
Ans. 

Q7. Apply the rules of Sarrus to find the determinant of the 3x3 matrix:
C = |1 2 3|
	|4 5 6|
	|7 8 9|
Ans. 
	|1 2 3| 1 2
	|4 5 6| 4 5
	|7 8 9| 7 8

	= 1x5x9 + 2x6x7 + 3x4x8 - 7x5x3 - 8x6x1 - 9x4x2
	= 45 + 84 + 96 - 105 - 48 - 72
	= 0
	
Q8. If K is a 2x3 matrix and L is a 3x2 matrix, what is the order of KL?
Ans. The product of two matrices, say K (mxn) and L(nxp), has an order
determined by the dimensions of the matrices involved. In this case:
	Matrix K is a 2x3 matrix (mxn).
	Matrix L is a 3x2 matrix (nxp).
The number of columns in the first matrix (K) must be equal to the number 
of rows in the second matrix (L) for the product to be defined.

In this scenario, the number of columns in K(3) is equal to the number of 
rows in L(3). Therefore, the product KL is defined, and its resulting matrix 
will have dimensions 2x2.

So, the oreder of KL is 2x2.
