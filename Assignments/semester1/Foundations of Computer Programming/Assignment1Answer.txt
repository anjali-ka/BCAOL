Q.20 Files included in a C program with .h extension are called as ____________
Ans: b) Header Files



Q1. Why and when do we use the #include directive?
Ans: The #include directive is a preprocessor directive. 
It's used to add the contents of a header file into a code file 
before compilation.
This makes the functions and definitions from the include file available
in the current source code file.

Q2. Why do we need to use comments in programs?
Ans: Comments are needed to make code easier for human to understand.
Comments are ignored by compiler so we can write anything in that.

Q3. Explain the process of transforming source code to .exe of a C program.
Ans: 

Q4. Explain the datatypes used in C language.
Ans: 

Q5. What is initialization? Why is it important?
Ans: Initialization is defining variable or constant values 
that will be used in code for further execution of program.
It is used when we want variable to have some initial value.

Q6. Write a C program to print your Name, Age, Date of Birth and Address. Every information should be printed in a new line.
Ans: 
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    printf ("Name: %s\n", "Alpha Beta");
    printf ("Age: %d\n", 21);
    printf ("Date of Birth: %s\n", "1995-10-23");
    printf ("Address: %s\n", "123 Somewhere in India");

    return 0;
}

Q7. Write a C program to find the sum, minus, product and division of two numbers.
Ans: 
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int a, b;
    a = 6;
    b = 2;
    printf ("Sum: %d\n", (a + b));
    printf ("Minus: %d\n", (a - b));
    printf ("Product: %d\n", (a * b));
    printf ("Division: %.2f\n", (a / (float)b));

    return 0;
}

Q8. Write a C program to find the factorial of a given number.
Ans: 
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int a;
    int f = 1;
    
    printf ("Enter the numbers to find factorial: \n");
    scanf("%d", &a);
    
    for (int i = 1; i <= a; i++) {
        f = f * i;
    }
    printf ("Factorial of %d is: %d\n", a, f);

    return 0;
}
