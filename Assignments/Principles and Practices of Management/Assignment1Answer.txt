Q2. Discuss the principles given by Henri Fayol to the Modern Management Thought.
Ans. Henri Fayol gave us 14 principles of management:
	1. Division of Work: To benefit from specialisation. It means entire task or work 
	should be divided among various employees in an organization. 
	It increase productivity and enhances morale of employees.
	2. Authority and Responsibility: Authority is the continuance of official and 
	private factors. Personal authority is derived from attributes such as intelligence, 
	experience, moral character, previous services, etc.
	Without authority responsiblity is useless. The level of authority that will be 
	granted to the staff should be in line with their level of responsiblity.
	3. Discipline: It should be applied to all employees in a company. Obedience, 
	application, effort, behaviour and an outward sign of respect are all components 
	of discipline among workers. Two kind of discipline are: self-imposed and command discipline.
	The best methods for upholding discipline are: competent managers at all levels; 
	transparent and equitable agrements between the parties; 
	and the judicious use of penalties.
	4. Unity of Command: A person should only receive directive and orders from 
	one superior. It has emphasised the need of unity of command in managing an 
	organisation. According to Fayol, if it is broken stability, order and discipline 
	are all affected, along with power.
	5. Unity of Direction: This state each set of activities with the same goal 
	needs to have a single leader and a single plan. It is more focused on 
	how the organisation functions with regard to its grouping of activities or planning.
	6. Subordination of Individual Interest to General Interest: Individual interest is 
	subordinate to the common goal. Wen there is conflict between two interests, 
	the general interest must come before the individual interest.
	Leader should be good and fair role model.
	7. Remuneration of Personnel: It should be equitable and aim to satisfy both 
	employers and employees to the fullest extent. Fayol supported profit sharing 
	plans for management but opposed then for employees. Though these could only 
	be provided in the case of very large enterprises, he was also in favour of 
	non-financial advantages.
	8. Centralization: How much the power is centralised or decentralised 
	without using the phrase "centralization of authority". In small businesses, 
	centralization is the norm but, in large businesses, a network of 
	intermediates is necessary.
	9. Scalar Chain: From top to lowest levels, there should be a scalar chain 
	of authority and communication. It implies that every message, whether 
	it is moving up or down the line of authority, must pass through every position.
	Only in exceptional situations, where its strict adherence would be 
	harmful to the organisation, may it be short-circuited. In order to achieve this, 
	Fayol has proposed the "gang plank," which is used to stop the scalar chain 
	from slowing down action.
	10. Order: This idea has to do with how things and people should be put in order.
	There should be a place for everything, and everything should be in its place, 
	in material order. In order to implement this theory, people, machinery, 
	and other resources must be arranged and placed in a systematic manner. 
	Misplacement would result in abuse and disorder.
	11. Equity: Equity refers to treating everyone equally and fairly. 
	It demands that managers be free of any biases or personal preferences.
	Healhty labour-management interactions are ensured by equity, 
	and these relations are crucial to the enterprise's efficient operation.
	12. Stability of Tenure of Personnel: According to this idea, every 
	employee must be guaranteed job stability. An employee will work harder 
	to deliver the highest performance if he feels secure in his employment.
	13. Initiative: Managers should foster initiative in their staff members 
	within the bounds of authority and discipline. Fayol recommends employers 
	to give their employees sufficient space to demonstrate initiative since 
	he believes it is one of the keenest pleasures an intelligent man can enjoy.
	Employees should be encouraged to offer any suggestions to develop and 
	carry out their goals, even if mistakes do occur.
	14. Esprit de Corps: This is the extension of the unity of command and 
	the principle "union is strength" for building a unified team. Fayol proposed 
	two strategies to do this: first, the divide-and-conquer mentality should 
	be avoided and second, verbal communication should be used to clear up 
	misunderstandings. This idea promotes increased productivity by reducing 
	resource misuse, wasting, and negligent usage of resources.
