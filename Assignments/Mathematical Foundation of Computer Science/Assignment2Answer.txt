Q1. What is probability theory primarily concerned with?
Ans. B) Uncertain outcomes

Q2. In probability theory, what does the term "random experiment" refer to?
Ans. B) An experiment with unpredictable outcomes

Q3. What is the set of all possible outcomes of a random experiment called?
Ans. C) Sample space

Q4. If two events cannot occur simultaneously, what is the term used to describe them?
Ans. A) Mutually exclusive

Q5. If event A and event B can both occur simultaneously, what is their relationship?
Ans. D) Dependent

Q6. Which method involves making a matrix upper triangular to find its determinant?
Ans. A) Elimination method

Q7. What is the sum of probabilities for all possible outcomes in a sample space?
Ans. B) 1

Q8. If P(A) is the probability of event A and P(B) is the probability of event B, what is P(A | B)?
Ans. C) P(A and B) / P(B)

Q9. If J is a 2x3 matrix and K is a 3x2 matrix, what is the order of the product JK?
Ans. C) 2x2

Q10. What is the formula for Bayes' Theorem?
Ans. A) P(A | B) = P(B | A) * P(A) / P(B)




Q1. If the probability of event A is 0.3, what is the probability of the complement of A?
Ans. The probability of the complement of event A((A^c)) is foud by subtracting 
the probability of A from 1. Therefore, if the probability of event A is 0.3,
the probability of the complement of A is:

P(A^c) = 1 - P(A) 
P(A^c) = 1 - 0.3 
P(A^c) = 0.7

So the probability of complement of A is 0.7

Q2. Given matrices F and G:
Ans. 

Q3. Consider two events A and B. If the probability of A is 0.4 and the probability of B is 0.6, what is the Law of Total Probability?
